# Automated-File-Sorter-in-File-Explorer-using-Python-Python-Project

This is a Python Project which can Sort the files present in your folder based on its type(.xlsx, .bmp, .txt etc). 

## Case Study
Here in this Notebook.ipynb, I've multiple files existed in a single folder.
(3 excel file, 3 txt files & 3 bmp file)

So this code will create 3 Individual folders (Excel Folder, Text Folder & BMP Folder) & all those 3 excel files will move into Excel Folder, likewise for others also.
